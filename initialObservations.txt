From the intial observation of the work flow, I was able to think of the following entities and
attributes. As next step I will be refining more attributes I might need. Also I would like to 
perform analysis on the relationships between the entites and their nature whether 1:1, 1:m or m:n
and any further relationship attributes we might need.

1. User (name , profile_photo, password) 

2. Projects(name, description, location, scheduled, recent) 

3. Tasks (Task name, description, scheduled time, startTime, finishTime)

4. Machine/Resource (name, id)

5. Company (name, id)

6. Administrator (Name, photo, id)
