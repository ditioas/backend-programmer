### Checkin flow in Ditio
One of the core functions of the Ditio application is to be able to register your working day.
On a normal working day, a worker arrives at a construction site and he will know from his foreman what tasks he is supposed to work on.
The worker then opens the Ditio app on his phone, looks for the right project, the task in the project and a machine that he will use in order to perform that task. 
As an example, his task of the day might involve digging a 10m wide ditch and he will need to use a certain excavator to achieve this task.

Once he is done and ready to go home in the evening, he will check out from the Ditio app.

An individual registration as described above is referred to as a "transaction" in Ditio.

### The objective
Could you make a simple pull request to this repository with an approximate MVP representation of a backend system which can acheieve this scenario?
1. Which entities would be required? 
2. Think about the minimum data models that are needed to represent these entities.
3. Make a simple API backed by a service to achieve CRUD operations related to Ditio transactions.
4. Remember that a user can work for multiple companies with the same Ditio account. How would you modify your data models in order to make this possible?

### Tips
1. All database operations can be shown as pseudo code.
2. Make frequent commits to the PR in order to demonstrate your thought process.
3. The goal of the exercise is to understand your way of thinking and if you are able to justify your design and architectural choices. So there are no wrong answers here.
