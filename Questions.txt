Q1: When a user changes the company. What happens to the project, resources and tasks?
I assume each company has its own set of project, resources and tasks and doesn't overlap
with other companies (p, r, t) ?

i.e a project, resource and task belong to a single company. Is this understanding correct?


Q2: I estimate we don't need the scale of google and facebook reaching 1B users for our database
design, based on some estimate and fair idea about which business ditio is in lets estimate the
range for the number of users be in range of 100k-10M as of now. So as to scope our discussion.
What do you think of this estimate?


Q3: There can be many projects inside the company, so the user is shown only a subset of it -
project he is been assigned/scheduled? So a company might have project p1, p2, p3, p4 etc.
But user A is scheduled for project p1, p3.

Is this understanding correct? 

Q4. Similarly, a project can have many tasks, so the user is shown only a subset of these tasks
or all the tasks?

Q5. I think resources are company wide entity and can be used across different projects and tasks
albeit only when free and not used in some other task. Is this understanding correct?
